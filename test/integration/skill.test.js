/**
 * For proper integration testing of Alexa skills, we would typically:
 * 
 * 1. Use the ASK SDK Testing utility (ask-sdk-test) which provides:
 *    - Virtual Alexa devices for end-to-end testing
 *    - Session simulation
 *    - Dialog management
 * 
 * 2. Create simulated conversation flows like:
 *    - User launches skill -> Alexa responds with welcome message
 *    - User asks for a state capital -> Alexa provides correct capital
 *    - User starts a quiz -> Alexa asks a question -> User answers correctly/incorrectly
 * 
 * 3. Use proper mocking of external services/databases
 * 
 * 4. Implement test cases for error handling and edge cases
 * 
 * Example of proper integration test code:
 * 
 * ```
 * const va = VirtualAlexa.Builder()
 *   .handler("index.handler")
 *   .interactionModelFile("models/en-US.json")
 *   .create();
 * 
 * // Test a complete dialog
 * const launchResponse = await va.launch();
 * expect(launchResponse.response.outputSpeech.ssml).to.include("Welcome to US Capitals");
 * 
 * const askResponse = await va.intend("Ask");
 * expect(askResponse.response.outputSpeech.ssml).to.include("What is the capital of");
 * 
 * // Get the state from the question and provide the right answer
 * const stateMatch = askResponse.response.outputSpeech.ssml.match(/What is the capital of ([A-Za-z\s]+)\?/);
 * const state = stateMatch[1];
 * const capital = getCapitalForState(state);
 * 
 * const answerResponse = await va.intend("Response", { Capital: capital });
 * expect(answerResponse.response.outputSpeech.ssml).to.include("You are correct");
 * ```
